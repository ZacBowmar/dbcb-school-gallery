This is a very fine piece of English embroidery from the early nineteenth century. Worked by a 10-year-old, it shows a degree of sophistication that reinforces the view that the standard of embroidery declined in the decades that followed. This is particularly striking when it is compared with the 1878 sampler by this sewer’s granddaughter. The 1818 work is dominated by a reasonably long moral verse with bands of spot motifs above and below. These include some interesting human figures as well as the more common plants, birds and animals. The standard alphabet and number sequences take up the top section and the whole is enclosed within an arcaded floral border pattern.
